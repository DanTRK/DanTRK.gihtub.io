I recently participated in the 3D GeoInfo + EG-ICE 2024 conference in Vigo, Spain. I presented my paper, ["The Significance of Porches in Urban Applications: A Method for Automated Modeling and Integration‚Äù](https://isprs-archives.copernicus.org/articles/XLVIII-4-W11-2024/9/2024/), which focused on improving urban 3D models for architectural visualization and planning. The presentation led to engaging discussions on practical applications in urban development. I also chaired a session, which allowed me to interact with researchers exploring innovations in geospatial technologies. A highlight was the social dinner in Baiona, where we enjoyed Galician cuisine and ocean views, providing a relaxed environment for networking and building new professional connections.
